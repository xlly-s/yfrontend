      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      
      <p>Your privacy is important to us. YTDownHub's policy is to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="https://ytdownhub.com">https://ytdownhub.com</a> (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "ytdownhub.com"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the website.

      <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
      <p>Like most website operators, YTDownHub collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. YTDownHub's purpose in collecting non personally identifying information is to understand better how YTDownHub's visitors use its website. From time to time, YTDownHub may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

      <h2>Log Files</h2>
      <p>ytdownhub.com follows a standard procedure of using log files. These files log visitors when they visit websites. All hosting companies do this and a part of hosting services' analytics.
